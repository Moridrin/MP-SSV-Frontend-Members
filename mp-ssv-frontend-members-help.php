<h1>General</h1>
This plugin generates a profile (and register) page with the components specified in the "Profile Page" (and "Register") tab.<br/>
In the "General" tab you can select three options for the register page: "Same as Profile Page" shows all fields from the Profile Page on the Registration Page, "Required Profile Page fields Only" shows only the Profile Page fields markt with the Required attribute (see "Attributes" for more information) and "Custom" this will display an extra tab named "Registration Page" where you can build the registration page with custom fields.<br/>
The Profile Page will be displayed on a page with post_name "profile" and content "[mp-ssv-frontend-members-profile]". The Registration Page will be displayed on a page with post_name "register" and content "[mp-ssv-frontend-members-register]".<br/>
<h1>Customizing the Profile Page</h1>
In this plugin you can create custom fields for your users. You can fully customize these fields the way you want by HTML. If you don't know HTML there is lots of useful information at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3School</a> and for more complex questions see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html">StackOverflow</a>.<br/>
And if you don't want to spend a lot of time, here are the basics and a couple of examples:<br/>
There are two important fields: "type" and "name".<br/>
Type defines what type of input field it is (<a href="" >click here</a> for examples).
